# Concept of Konashi

Konashi mades developing physical-computing things easy.  

Physical-computing is a concept which envisions new interactions between people and computers in our everyday environment. It was first proposed by by Dan O’Sullivan of New York University[1]. This concept is expected to make possible interactions which are beyond the limitations of current computer systems. For example, by measuring the movements of players, Kinect for Xbox360 changed the way people play games and experience entertaiment.

But there are some large difficulties faced when trying to design a physical-computing interface. Developing a device based on the concept of physical computing is an undertaking comparable to recreating the input-output system of a current personal computer. To such facilitate innovation cross-sector collaboration is a must. However, if designers and engineers cannot understand each others' field, it is very difficult to communicate complex ideas.

In order to address this difficulty, a device which can connect designers and engineers, and serve as a translator for their ideas is needed.

Some examples of such a device are “Gainer”, “Funnel” and “Arduino”, which have been developed as toolkits for a physical computing using a PC.

These toolkits are a small-size computer designed to be extension equipment for modern computer input and output systems. They are also designed to be easy to understand for designers who are not engineers. On the bounty of highly-modularized input and output systems, these toolkits are widely favoured among artists, designers and engineers as a tool for realising their physical computing ideas.

However, in recent years, it seems that the meaning of "computer" in our lives is shifting from desktops and notebooks to smartphones and tablets. With that in mind, we developed Konashi as a physical computing toolkit tailored for smartphones and tablets. Anybody can take advantage of Konashi by using our open-source library "konashi-ios-sdk2" and development environment for smartphone and tablet apps.
